# The Analyst: Unified Marketing Analytics Stack

## Spark
The company's analytics were fragmented and unreliable, leading to attribution drift and wasted ad spend. Without a single source of truth for conversion data, it was impossible to make confident, data-driven decisions about marketing budgets. The existing setup was a patchwork of legacy tags, duplicate tracking, and inconsistent event naming that made reliable reporting nearly impossible.

The challenge was rebuilding the entire measurement foundation while maintaining data continuity and ensuring accurate attribution for ongoing campaigns.

## Blueprint
I rebuilt the entire measurement stack from the ground up in Google Tag Manager. This wasn't just a cleanupâ€”it was a complete architectural overhaul that created a unified, reliable foundation for all marketing analytics.

**Analytics Architecture Rebuild:**
- **Legacy Tag Audit**: Comprehensive review and removal of all outdated tracking codes
- **GTM Container Restructuring**: Clean, organized container with proper naming conventions
- **GA4 Migration**: Complete transition from Universal Analytics to GA4 with enhanced ecommerce
- **Event Standardization**: Consistent naming schema across all conversion touchpoints

**Data Layer Implementation:**
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Accurate purchase tracking with product details and revenue
- **Gravity Forms Tracking**: Form submission events with lead qualification data
- **User Journey Mapping**: Complete funnel tracking from awareness to conversion
- **Cross-Domain Tracking**: Unified user sessions across multiple properties

**Conversion Event Optimization:**
- **High-Intent Signal Focus**: Prioritized actual sales over vanity metrics
- **Smart Bidding Optimization**: Clean conversion data for Google's machine learning
- **Attribution Model Setup**: Data-driven attribution replacing last-click models
- **Custom Dimensions**: Enhanced segmentation for deeper insights

**Quality Assurance Process:**
- **Tag Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all tracking implementations
- **Data Validation**: Cross-referencing with server-side data for accuracy
- **Historical Data Preservation**: Careful migration ensuring no data loss
- **Stakeholder Training**: Team education on new reporting capabilities
