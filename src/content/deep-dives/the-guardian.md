**Subtitle:** Compliance & Data Architecture for Trust at Scale  
**Tags:** Data • Privacy • Consent • Governance

## Key Takeaways
- Centralized consent; built defensible data flows

- Standardized event schemas across web/app/CRM
- Mapped data lineage; implemented least-privilege access
- Created review rituals: privacy, retention, opt-out handling

## The Impact
- Reduced risk; faster approvals for experimentation
- Cleaner joins; analytics unlocked without legal whiplash
- Better user trust → higher opt-ins
