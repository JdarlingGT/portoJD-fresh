# The Engine Room
**Subtitle:** Server-Level Tuning for Stability & Speed  
**Tags:** DevOps • Observability • Tuning

## Key Takeaways
- Tuned PHP-FPM/OPcache; optimized workers; right-sized infra
- Observability (Netdata) exposed hot paths; fixes were targeted
- Stable performance under load = happy users

## The Spark
Random slowdowns and 500s under load with little visibility.

## The Blueprint
- Profiling (blackfire/xhprof opt); DB indices; query cache
- PHP-FPM pool tuning; OPcache params; HTTP/2, brotli
- Netdata dashboards + alerts; weekly review rituals
- Git hooks + preview envs to reduce risky deploys

## The Impact
- Fewer error spikes; better CWV; reduced support noise
- Faster deploys with guardrails; rollback confidence

## Tech Stack
PHP-FPM • OPcache • Netdata • MySQL tuning • Nginx/Apache

## Metrics to Watch
Error rate • p95 response • DB time • Apdex
