# The Conductor
**Subtitle:** Orchestrating Data & Automations Across the Stack  
**Tags:** Integrations • Workflow • Orchestration

## Key Takeaways
- Connected web, LMS, CRM with event pipes and business rules
- Reduced manual updates; fewer mismatches; cleaner reporting
- Teams ship faster with confidence

## The Spark
Teams worked in silos. Progress wasn't reflected across systems; ops lagged behind marketing.

## The Blueprint
- Event router (webhooks, Uncanny Automator, WP Fusion)
- Idempotent handlers; retries; dead-letter queue policy
- Role-based visibility; dashboards for each team's needs
- Change logs + rollback plan

## The Impact
- Less manual work; fewer sync errors
- Near-real-time reporting; stakeholders aligned
- Faster campaign setup; lower ops cost

## Tech Stack
Uncanny Automator • WP Fusion • CRM • Webhooks • Queue (opt)

## Metrics to Watch
Sync error rate • Time-to-live data • Manual touch count • SLA adherence
