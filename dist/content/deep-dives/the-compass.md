## The Challenge

Our marketing team was flying blind, unable to accurately attribute revenue to their campaigns. We needed a data-driven way to measure the ROI of our marketing efforts.

## The Solution

I built 'The Compass,' an advanced analytics and attribution modeling system using Google BigQuery and Looker Studio. This provided a clear, multi-touch view of the customer journey, enabling us to optimize our marketing spend and drive significant growth.
