## The Challenge

Our live-streamed events were causing our servers to crash, leading to a poor user experience and lost revenue. We needed an infrastructure that could handle unpredictable traffic spikes without breaking a sweat.

## The Solution

I designed and implemented 'The Fortress,' a highly scalable and resilient infrastructure on AWS using Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Load Balancing, and a multi-region CDN. This ensured our platform remained stable and performant, even during our largest events.
