## The Challenge

Our manual deployment process was slow, error-prone, and a major bottleneck for our development team. We needed to automate our build, test, and deployment process to increase velocity and reduce risk.

## The Solution

I built 'The Conductor,' a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline automated everything from linting and testing to building and deploying our application, enabling us to ship features faster and with greater confidence.
