## The Challenge

Our collaborative whiteboard application was suffering from high latency and poor performance, making it unusable for our customers. We needed a backend that could handle a large number of concurrent users with minimal delay.

## The Solution

I re-architected our backend using Go and WebSockets to create 'The Engine Room,' a high-performance, low-latency system capable of supporting thousands of concurrent users. This dramatically improved the user experience and set the stage for future growth.
